# Financial Accounting

## Why is it important?

1. For the purpose of your investors, because you need to report truthfully.
    - Financial standards are to be followed, called the "generally accepted accounting principles" (GAAP)
2. You need to have accountability to the government, because you need to pay taxes based on your reports.
    - The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has regulations to make sure that reports are truthful and reliable
    - Audited financial statements are mandated by the industry
    - A future accountant would need to take a test to become a "certified public accountant" (CPA)
