bro i need advice

do you know of any useful way to integrate genetic algorithms or artificial intelligence in a case like calculating statistics from big data?

**Soard**

I don't think it would really be used for a task like that


Take a look at the R programming language

Seems like what you are looking for

Probably over complicated

**Emecs**

what do you think about this example for AI

Lets say I want to group -------- who are passionate in a field of work. They submit structured data (--------) as well as unstructured data (------------)
can AI analyze someone with a low ------- but an awesome -------- and put them into a "passionate" group

or high ----- but sucky ----- etc

document analysis kind of thing

**Soard**

Well yes technically

GAs definitely cant

**Emecs**

GAs?

**Soard**

Unless you write a super complicated function that denotes 100% what is a good -----

Genetic algorithm

**Emecs**

ah

**Soard**

Ai you might need some sample good -----

**Emecs**

how many? 100,000?

or completely depends

**Soard**

Check out statistical reasoning and fuzzy logic

you basically need to supply thousands of "good" -----

the algorithm will have to look for commonalities between all of them
an ------- which has the most prevalent of these commonalities has a higher statistical probability of being 'good'
for example say [criterion A] is a commonality, which of course it is
that adds some statistical likelihood of it being good

that's generally how ai and virtual human programs operate

**Emecs**

you have any previous resources on that i can read on? would really appreciate it.

**Soard**

i may have some virtual human stuff, but it's not really that related
just the whole idea of statistical reasoning

**Emecs**

any on fuzzy/statistical reasoning?
ohh

**Soard**

tbh you are going to need some serious resources to do this project, if that's your intention

i mean, to do it well

a computer isn't really the best method of reading an ------, otherwise the ---- and ---- would do it

**Emecs**

but ---/---- thinks it cheaper to pay ------------- salary than to invest in an R&D for AI to ------ -------

**Soard**

i suppose, but if ----/----- thinks it's expensive, how can you feasibly do it?

**Emecs**

clutch. for the next 4 years.

**Soard**

this is something that would take years to develop

**Soard**

with a team
but go for it
i gotta say though, it's not gonna be easy. you are going to need to massively improve your basics before going forward
think about the language, cause i'll tell you now Java isn't the one to go with here

**Emecs**

what's the typical language for AI dev?
octave/matlab?

**Soard**

I'm no expert but, in the college course i'm doing now a lot of people swear by Lisp and Prolog
i use C/C++
since that's what a lot of real worl implementations use
Python is good too for proof of concept
general industry belief is lisp is good for prototyping
c++ for widespread release
alternatively u can code the base of the app in C++, then code a customized LISP interpreter
for AI, I see a shit ton of Git projects do that too

AI needs to be fucking optimized to be workable
Java while an awesome language, is not optimized at all
cause you can't manage memory yourself
it does it all for you

**Emecs**

don't huge companies use java mainly for services & big data though?
i know accenture uses it

**Soard**

yes, but it doesn't need to process that data fast and on the spot
it's ok if it takes a while
if you are ok with significant load times
after submitting credentials that's ok i guess
not a big Java fan for AI though, less libraries available
also

third one has some specifics on how it works

second one has some problems with most applications like this

first one is a general overview

check out machine learning too

**Emecs**

isn't ---- proof of concept that it works
basically the ---- ------ has a whole bunch of criteria that it checks in the ----. these criteria were formed and formulated by sample data. that's general idea correct?
others just say that the criteria that these ----- -----  have are not enough to judge a -------...

**Emecs**

--QUOTE REMOVED--

**Emecs**

but can't the ---- ------ check a sample of 1M ----- for ------, then for --------, etc. ?
given enough research time, the system can be indeed robust
i'll research and get back to you in a few days
