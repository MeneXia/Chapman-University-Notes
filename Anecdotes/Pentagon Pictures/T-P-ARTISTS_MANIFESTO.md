# T:P - Artist's Manifesto

1. **Creativity is a Contributing Force** - Businesses are the car and creativity is the gas needed to help them cross the road to greatness. Though they have the option of pushing the car themselves, creativity would without a doubt get them across the road faster.

2. **Raise Up to Your Ability.** Do not think about what you could achieve - step up and say you can achieve it.

3. **Don’t Let the Bastards Grind You Down** - A great thing about design is its ability to make others feel stupid because they wished they had that idea first or were simply not fast enough to act on it. Many within our society have difficulty understanding the world through the eyes of the artist, therefore they try to ignore this by mocking them as a result. 

4. **Safe is the Enemy of Greatness** - There are rules that are established as right or wrong by society and eventually creates an immense boundary of beliefs that make us question if something feels right or wrong, however true artists refrain from staying safe and attempt to break this barrier - art is subjective, therefore we must take advantage of this opportunity to provoke a message to the viewer or reader and make them think.

5. **Mock Tradition and Rebel With Passion** - Do not rebel with violence, but instead, provoke through through the use of words or visuals while maintaining passion. Art is a liberation, and by not having passion or desire will get you absolutely no where.

6. **Live Fast Fly Young** - The time in life is underestimated by many - don’t be one of them. Live fast with passion to do and achieve as much as you can and soon, you will find yourself mentally in glee and flight whilst you still have plenty of time to kill.
