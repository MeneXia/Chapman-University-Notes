# PENTAGON PICTURES

An engaging group of passionate film makers who make it their duty to never let you down (video wise).

## OUR MOTTO

"Weniger aber besser."

"Less but better."

\- Dieter Rams

## DISCLAIMER

You need to understand that we are completely unrelated to any school or formal organization. We started this ourselves, and we've been operating independently ever since, and we're going to keep it that way. Because of our independent nature, being a part of Pentagon has been an awesome learning experience that we'd like to extend towards other fellow students.

## OUR MANIFESTO

One of the main things that caused the formation of this group was that we wanted to be flexible.

1. We do not have any member hierarchy (e.g. producer > director > cinematographer). We believe this destroys creative flow, because any student producer, at any one time, could potentially change elements of a movie that any student director did not intend for.

2. We do not have specified roles per project. Everybody contributes, switching between the roles of a: cinematographer, editor, animator, or manager. One member could specialize into one particular role and can be recognized by the group for it, however should be expected to take on other roles at times. We also believe that everybody should take part in being a director and contributing to how any movie we make will play out.

3. We operate under a laissez-faire leadership style, where we make our own deadlines. But don't let this fool you into thinking we're lazy, because we either meet expectations or exceed them.

4. Every project should be a learning opportunity. You will gain real-world experience in the realm of film-making from all different aspects. Whether it be service - doing pro-bono work by interning with other clients you find outside of ISM, entrepreneurial - finding pay out of the videos you make, or political, it's all makes for a fantastic learning experience. We highly encourage our members to take risks, do something new, relate filmmaking to other hobbies, or instigate change in society today, by simply making movies.

5. We should invest greatly into equipment that makes our production guaranteed to showcase the best of our abilities.

6. Pre-planning is the key to success.
