# Version Control

1. System that records changes to a file or set of files
2. Centralised VCS (Subversion) if server is down, you can't commit/get updates
3. Distributed VCS (Git) Local version of repository

## States of Files

1. Modified
2. Staged
3. Committed

Diff is a difference

Merge conflict messes with your file and shows you the lines that you need to fix when you commit
